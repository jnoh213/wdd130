    <h2> Jack Nelson </h2> 
    <p>     Hello I am Jack Nelson! I have been a member of the Church for my entitre life. 
            It is my first Semester in BYUI and I am majoring in Computer Science.
            I came to BYUI so that I could change my enviroment. I love how much more open it is here in Idaho.</p>
    <p>
            I see Learning Web Development as an important and necessary action for me to continue to use the internet in the future.
            And to me having a lack of knowlege involving something that I use every day is a problem that I want to fix. 
            And I hope that learning about this will help me in any field, ComputerScience related or not.
    </p>
    <p>     
        I am excited to begin my college Expirence and hope to be able to grow more as a person!
    </p>
